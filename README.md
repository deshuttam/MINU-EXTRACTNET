# MINU-EXTRACTNET: Automatic Latent Fingerprint Feature Extraction System Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network

By Uttam Deshpande et. al.,







A Deep Convolutional Neural Network  (DCNN) model called “Minu-ExtractNet” performs pre-processing using “Pre-ProcessNet”. This model enhances the quality of the latent and produces the orientation information along with different segmentation masks. Later, pre-processed information is then used to extract the minutiae feature points using another CNN model called “ExtractNet”. This feature extractor model performs the image quality assessment to determine the threshold value to filter out spurious minutiae points. A dynamic thresholding algorithm is developed to achieve this goal.
